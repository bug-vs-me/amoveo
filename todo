* use the new db when processing blocks.

* use the new db when making proofs for the api.

* make sure the state root in the header is being calculated reasonably. Look at what block:merkelize is doing to the proofs in the block.

* generating txs should work with the new version of trees.
  trees:get/2 should work with verkle 

  -coinbase_tx:make/2 should use trees:get/2

* switch over all the governance values to be hard coded instead of in the database.
  - trees:get/4 with tag governance should be hard coded.
  - governance:dict_get_value/2 should return hard coded values after the hard update. (and so it needs to know what height it is being called from.)
  
* use the new db when generating bocks.
  - block:hash should work with the new format of trees and roots.

* in block_db, instead of storing proofs for every block on a page, store a single proof for all the consensus state you need to verify that entire page.
  - replace the proofs in the blocks with the merkle root of that proof.
  - block hash should work, even if you don't re-create the verkle proof for that block.
  - make sure that the syncing node knows how to handle this.


* make sure serializing to json for http works, and that the light node can verify the proofs.

* block access to the old tree after the update.

* set the correct update height.
