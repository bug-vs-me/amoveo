* it is important that the verkle tree has the ability to delete old data. We only want to ever revert like 50 blocks, so we can delete consensus state from before then.


* get the new trees working with the kind of data we want. use meta for the tree type, and location in the O(1) db.
 - trees2:store/3 needs to be implemented. combining the dump with the verkle tree.

* transfering the consensus state into the new tree. (or maintaining them both in parallel?)

* the new versions of transactions that will all be using the new tree.

* block access to the old tree after the update.

* make sure serializing to json for http works, and that the light node can verify the proofs.

* set the correct update height.
