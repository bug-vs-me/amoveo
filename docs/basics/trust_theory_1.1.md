Trust Theory 1.1
==========

Security level 1.1 is the most powerful kind of security available, so it is good to find out what kinds of financial contracts can happen in 1.1
1.1 is also the least expensive level of security. Apps that can have level 1.1 are cheaper and will outcompete the competition by undercutting their price.

Determinisitic computations that can be run in a short time are in security level 1.1
For example, bitcoin scripts.

If Amoveo's oracle works, then it is possible to have an oracle in 1.1, which means mechanisms in 1.1 can have access to any public data.

That means in 1.1 we can make contracts between pairs of people such that the amount of money that each party gets depends on the output of the results of arbitrary events fed into an arbitrary deterministic program.

Hashtimelocks are a tool in 1.1 that allow us to connect contracts together, so the states of the different contracts update atomically.

So it is always possible to use 1.1 to write arbitrarily precise versions of mechanisms as long as it is possible to decompose that mechanism into some turing complete piece of software, and facts from the oracle.

Epistemologically speaking, everything we can know is a combination of what we can calculate, and what we can look up. People are only interested in having financial apps who's outcome is related to information we can know.

therefore:
any financial application that people would be interested in using can be written at security level 1.1


corollary:
Since level 1.1 is both cheaper and more secure than any other level, any financial app that is not written to security level 1.1 will inevitably fail to competition that is at level 1.1.
