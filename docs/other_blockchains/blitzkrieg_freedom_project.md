Economics of Blitzkrieg Payments
=========

Blitzkrieg is an interesting project because they use a 4.1 level security mechanism, but they keep the portion of money locked inside the 4.1 part of the mechanism very small. The vast majority of the funds are in 2.2 level security parts of the blockchain.

The goal of this paper is to find out how effective this trick can be, and when it makes sense to use it.

The costs we want to measure are:
* cost due to risk in probabilistic payments. You could get unlucky and lose a lot of money.
* cost due to trusting the finder.
