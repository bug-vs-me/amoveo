Optimistic Rollups Review
===========

Optimistic rollups are a tool for efficiently making large quantities of data available to a blockchain consensus mechanism. Here is the paper introducing them: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06441.pdf

Here is a podcast where they talk about how it works. https://thebitcoinpodcast.com/hashing-it-out-67/

Making data available at such a high rate is an impressive achievement. This is some of the coolest research happening in blockchain right now, so I had to write a review.

Here is a blog post that explains the plan to combine optimistic rollups with an erasure encoded database to allow for quadratic scaling https://ethresear.ch/t/on-chain-non-interactive-data-availability-proofs/5715

The goal of these efforts is to try and enable scalable stablecoin payments.
