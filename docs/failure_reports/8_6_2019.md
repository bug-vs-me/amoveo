======

On this date, for a period of about 7 hours, which is about 38 blocks worth of time, the mining pools were unable to produce any blocks.

Loss
=====

38 blocks * 0.16 veo block reward * $115 per veo =

about $ of hashpower was wasted because of my mistake, and I sincerely apologize to miners and mining pools who are paying this cost.

What happened
======

The mining pools were only finding invalid blocks.

It seems like multiple nodes all had corrupted databases preventing them from finding blocks at the same time.
We were not handling this failure mode well, it wasn't clear what was happening, or what we needed to do to fix it.

We did an update so now you can more easily tell if your database is corrupted. you can do potential_block:read(). to see if your node can produce blocks, and if that crashes, then it means you need to resync.

This is a workaround for now, until we can find out what is corrupting the databases.


we also did an upgrade so that if a tx will fail the counterfit test, now it fails at the step of adding it to the mempool, instead of the step of syncing a block that already has POW.
Hopefully these changes will prevent mining pools from wasting so much time in the future.
